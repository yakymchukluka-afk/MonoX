# 🔄 Agent Handoff: Complete MonoX HF Space Training Launch

## 🎯 **Current Status: 95% Complete - Need Final Push & Training Start**

### ✅ **What's Already Fixed & Working:**
1. **HF Space is RUNNING** - FastAPI server active on port 7860
2. **Docker build SUCCESSFUL** - CUDA 11.8 environment ready
3. **FastAPI endpoints ready** - `/`, `/health`, `/training/start/gpu`, etc.
4. **Files prepared locally** - All fixes committed and ready to push

### 🚧 **What Needs Completion:**
1. **Push final files to HF Space** (git push timing out)
2. **Start training via API** or direct execution
3. **Verify training is running** and producing outputs

---

## 📋 **Immediate Next Steps:**

### Step 1: Push Training Scripts to HF Space
```bash
cd /workspace
git push hf cursor/fix-hf-docker-space-build-and-validate-app-7a95:main
```
**Issue**: Git push keeps timing out. Try:
- Shorter timeout
- Force push if needed
- Or manually copy files to HF Space repo

### Step 2: Start Training (Choose ONE method):

**Option A - Via FastAPI API:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://lukua-monox.hf.space/training/start/gpu
# OR if no GPU:
curl -X POST https://lukua-monox.hf.space/training/start/cpu
```

**Option B - Direct execution in HF Space:**
```bash
python3 start_training_now.py
```

**Option C - Via API trigger script:**
```bash
python3 trigger_training_api.py
```

### Step 3: Verify Training Started
```bash
curl https://lukua-monox.hf.space/training/status
```

## 🔧 **Key Files Ready to Deploy:**

### `/workspace/start_training_now.py` - Direct training launcher
- Checks GPU availability
- Finds best training script (gpu_gan_training.py, etc.)
- Starts training in background
- Monitors initial progress

### `/workspace/trigger_training_api.py` - API-based trigger
- Tests all FastAPI endpoints
- Starts training via POST requests
- Monitors progress

### **Updated Core Files:**
- `Dockerfile` - CUDA PyTorch base image ✅
- `app.py` - FastAPI with training endpoints ✅  
- `requirements.txt` - Minimal FastAPI deps ✅

## 🎯 **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Training scripts pushed to HF Space
- [ ] Training started (GPU preferred, CPU fallback)
- [ ] API returns training status
- [ ] Generated samples appear in `/previews/`
- [ ] Checkpoints saved in `/checkpoints/`

## 🔑 **Credentials & URLs:**
- **HF Token**: `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`
- **HF Space**: https://huggingface.co/spaces/lukua/monox
- **API Base**: https://lukua-monox.hf.space (when live)

---

## 🐛 **Current Blocker:**
Git push to HF Space times out. The HF Space is already running the FastAPI server successfully, but the latest training scripts aren't deployed yet.

**Workaround Options:**
1. Try git push with shorter timeout
2. Use HF Hub API to upload files
3. Manually copy files via HF web interface
4. Execute training directly on current HF Space files

---

## 💡 **Quick Win Path:**
Since HF Space is already running, you could:
1. Access the running space directly
2. Execute existing training scripts (many available: `gpu_gan_training.py`, `simple_gan_training.py`, etc.)
3. Use the FastAPI endpoints to start training
4. Skip the git push for now and focus on getting training started

The infrastructure is ready - just need to trigger the training process!
