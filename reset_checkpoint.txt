Reset Commit: 4e42c0a29bb8c3886a79a7424b7b26c1ae117412
Reset Commit Message: "Standardize MonoX entrypoint and add comprehensive documentation"
Reset Commit Date: Tue Aug 26 16:27:08 2025

REASON FOR RESET:
- Repository became cluttered with numerous Hugging Face training integration attempts
- Training scripts and experimental code accumulated from August 28-31, 2025
- Need to restore clean, working baseline before HF integration began

WHAT WAS PRESERVED:
✅ Core MonoX project structure (configs/, src/, scripts/)
✅ Original train.py with Hydra configuration
✅ StyleGAN-V submodule integration
✅ Makefile and project documentation
✅ Clean requirements.txt with essential dependencies

WHAT WAS ADDED BACK:
✅ FastAPI application (app.py) for latent walk generation
✅ Updated requirements.txt with FastAPI dependencies
✅ JSON saving logic for walk metadata
✅ Health check and API documentation endpoints

WHAT WAS MOVED TO /deprecated/:
📁 All training experiment scripts (100+ files)
📁 Colab setup and GPU training scripts
📁 Docker files for HF Spaces
📁 Training diagnostics and monitoring tools
📁 All markdown documentation from training attempts

CURRENT CLEAN STATE:
- Functional FastAPI service for latent walk generation
- Clean project structure based on August 26, 2025 baseline
- All HF training logic preserved in /deprecated/ for future reference
- Ready for isolated HF integration in separate pipeline/module

NEXT STEPS:
- HF training integration should be developed as separate module
- Keep main Space focused on latent walk generation
- Use /deprecated/ files as reference for future training pipeline
